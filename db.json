      "des2Titel":"",
      "des2":"Sisodia and AAP hit out at the Bharatiya Janata Party at the Centre, terming the agency action as drama. CBI officials clarified that such an LOC had not been issued, but it is likely that such circulars will be issued against Sisodia and others accused in connection with the Delhi excise policy scam. In latest update, the CBI has issued Look Out Circulars against 8 persons in connection with the Delhi Excise Policy case. However, there is no clarity on LOC against Sisodia till now. ",
      "des3Title":"What is a Look Out Circular (LOC)?",
      "des3":"Called a Look Out Circular, it is a letter that the authorities used to keep a check on overseas travel by a person who is 'wanted' by any agency or the police. It can be used in immigration checks at international borders to prevent such a person from travelling abroad. </br> It is often issued against a person who is wanted or absconding to ensure they do not leave the country. Immigation branches use it at international airport and seaport check points. <br /> There are different types of LOCs. In certain categories, a person can only go abroad after seeking due permission and informing the concerned agency. In others, a person can be completely barred from leaving the country. ",
      "des4Title":"What happens after an LOC is issued?",
      "des4":"When an LOC is issued, the Bureau of Immigration (BoI) is informed by concerned agencies about the individual who might leave the country without giving law enforcement agencies prior information. <br/> The BoI then sends the information to its officials at immigration checkpoints who then stay on alert about such a person trying to get out of the country.",

Once issued, it would bar the individuals from travelling abroad until further orders. <br/> This comes after the CBI conducted raids at 21 places in Delhi-NCR including Sisodia's residence and residences of four public servants.

The convicts, who were sentenced to life imprisonment, were released as per the remission policy in India. <br/> All eleven convicts who were found guilty in the horrific gang rape and multiple murder cases that took place during the 2002 Gujarat riots were released after serving a little over 14 years of their life imprisonment sentence, sparking a wave of criticism against the Gujarat government by opposition leaders. <br/>On March 3, 2002, Bilkis Bano's family was attacked by a mob at Randhikpur village in Limkheda taluka of Dahod district during the post-Godhra riots. Bilkis, who was five months pregnant at that time, was gang-raped and seven members of her family were killed.",
      "des2Titel":"Outrage over the release of Bilkis Bano gang rape convicts",
      "des2":"Even before the family of Bilkis Bano expressed their shock and despair over the release of her rapists, opposition leaders and the legal fraternity slammed the decision of the Gujarat government, terming the decision as \"shameful\" and \"disgraceful\". <br/> Taking a jibe at the Centre, TRS leader K Kavitha said, “The decision to release the heinous criminals of rape and murder during the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav is an insult to this auspicious day.” <br/> Taking into account the plight of Bilkis Bano, Supreme Court Advocate Yash Giri said, “The trust of people in the Indian Judicial System is shaken by the new Remission policy of the Gujarat Government, the trauma of the victim cannot be superseded by the right of remission given to the convicts in heinous offences of rape and murder.”",
      "des3Title":"Why were Bilkis Bano's rapists released from jail?",

While Article 72 gives the President the authority to remit a sentence, CrPC Section 433 provides the appropriate government the power to suspend or remit sentences.<br/> This section states that the remission application can be placed in front of the appropriate government, which can further take a call on the sentence of the person. The government will later have to present its argument for granting remission in front of the court, seeking the bench's final approval.",

The paediatrician advised them to take the girl to a community hospital, where she was treated for dehydration and prescribed paracetamol. <br/>Later, she was shifted back to the hospital where she was admitted between 9 pm and 10 pm before being declared dead.

The court also ordered the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief to appear before an anti-terrorism court (ATC) before his bail ran out. <br/>    Judge Raja Jawad Abbas Hassan accepted Khan's pre-arrest bail application against a bond of 100,000 Pakistani Rupees shortly after he appeared before the ATC earlier in the day, according to Geo TV. The court issued notices to the police and the petitioner while protecting Khan from arrest. <br/>   In his bail plea, Khan stated that the terrorism case against him was registered by police as an “act of revenge”. <br/>   Rana Sanaullah, Pakistan's interior minister, previously indicated that Imran Khan would be arrested as soon as his three-day protective bail expires on August 25. The interior ministry reportedly wrote to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's office requesting authorisation to arrest Khan in connection with the terror case. <br/>   A large police presence was visible outside the anti-terrorism court in Islamabad ahead of Khan's appearance. If the ex-PTI PM's party was arrested, followers are encouraged to take to the streets and march to the capital. <br/>   Imran Khan was charged under Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act (penalty for terrorist actions) for remarks he made at an Islamabad rally on August 20, in which he threatened to sue police personnel and a female judge and claimed that a close aide had been tortured after his arrest.",

The amended privacy policy for the Meta-owned instant messaging platform from 2021 was the subject of a CCI investigation order. <br/>  The single judge's ruling was well-reasoned, according to a bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Subramonium Prasad, and the appeals lack merit. A single judge had earlier in April of last year declined to suspend the CCI's inquiry into the petitions filed by WhatsApp and Facebook. The bench had kept the order reserved on July 25, 2022, after the completion of the submissions by all sides. <br/> The antitrust agency had stated that the investigation's focus was on WhatsApp's anti-competitive sharing of user data with Facebook, not concerns with privacy rules, and that the investigation could not be obstructed by a court process <h2>WhatsApp's claim: </h2> Based on news reports, the CCI independently decided to investigate WhatsApp's amended privacy policy in January of last year.<br/> WhatsApp had claimed before the court's division bench that the CCI cannot look into a policy that has been put on hold while waiting for the outcome of the Data Protection Bill and the rulings of the Supreme Court and the High Court about the policy's legality. <h2>Facebook's claim: </h2> Facebook had argued that there was no evidence to support the case made against it and that the CCI could not conduct a \"creeping\" investigation against it. <br/>  However, the CCI had argued that its investigation into the new privacy policy should be permitted to move forward because the policy has not been withdrawn and because there is no chance that the investigation will conflict with the Supreme Court proceedings, which deal with issues of alleged violations of user privacy. <br/> It had also defended the probe against Facebook as well as in connection with WhatsApp's privacy policy, saying the former is the holding company of the messaging platform and can \"potentially exploit the data being shared\".<br/> Before the single judge, WhatsApp and Facebook had challenged the CCI's March 2021 order directing a probe against them. <br/>   Dismissing the petitions, the single judge had opined that although it would have been \"prudent\" for the CCI to await the outcome of the petitions in the Supreme Court and the Delhi High Court against WhatsApp's new privacy policy, not doing so would not make the regulator's order \"perverse\" or \"wanting of jurisdiction\".<br/>   On January 3, while dealing with the appeals against the single-judge order, a bench headed by then Chief Justice DN Patel had extended the time for filing replies by Facebook and WhatsApp to two CCI notices of June 2021, asking them to furnish certain information for the purpose of the inquiry conducted by it.",

      "title":"E'clat Superior introduces the new packaging of its Vitamin C Serum",
      "subtitle":"The e'clat superior's serums have become one among the fastest-growing premium skincare",
      "description":"In today's technology-driven world, brands cannot become complacent or assume that customers will always support them in the very competitive cosmetics market. Statistics show that customers are open to trying new things, and the most frequent buyers typically buy up to eight different brands. This is where the packaging of these products turns out to be a knight in the shining armor. Packaging generally serves to protect, advertise, inform, and sell, but skincare brands have a higher responsibility to draw in customers. If one intends to stand out on busy department store shelves then it is significant that the construction should be svelte with minimal negative space. Owing to the very same aspect, luxury skincare brand e'clat Superior has recently launched new and improved packaging for its Vitamin C Serum which is for skin brightening and radiance. <br/> The e'clat superior's serums have become one among the fastest-growing premium skincare product because they are unquestionably more effective than typical creams and moisturisers. For people who have a skincare routine and want to continue nurturing their skin every day, this product is the best option to opt for. Since this luxury skincare brand is well-versed with the fact that consumers may find it difficult to distinguish between the many claims made about the contents of different skin care products and the packaging is instantly recognizable and offers a reliable means of distinction. This is what led to the inception of this conspicuous new packaging which is designed to elevate the brand with decorative elements that draw viewers in. <br/> It is integral to examine the ingredients in the serum to see if they will provide your skin with the much-needed boost. The virtues of vitamin C in terms of beauty have long been lauded as this super antioxidant has the capability to lighten skin, combat free radicals, and remove pigmentation like no other. So it's reasonable to say that a lot of us might profit from including one of the top vitamin C serums. Considering the intrinsic features of this vitamin c serum, it is one of the best on the market because it is paraben-free, dermatologist-tested, reasonably priced, and versatile. The e'clat superior Vitamin C Serum helps to reduce the appearance of wrinkles while also enhancing skin tone and luminosity through several vitamin C usages. <br/> When asked about what is his take towards the problems that the skincare industry giants are facing in the packaging of the products, Founder of e'clat superior, Sandeep Gupta stated, \"In my opinion, anybody that is accustomed to the skincare and cosmetic industry is not alienated by the fact that with the passage of time it is constantly getting harder for firms to decipher how to manage the hindrance when it comes to packaging as consumer expectations for sustainability grow. Should you advocate zero waste, employ 100% PCR materials, or experiment with new, cutting-edge materials? The transition to sustainability cannot be accomplished easily. Moreover, environmentally conscious customers are increasingly inquiring about the materials used in beauty brand packaging. The key to this is bringing in innovation and enhancing the vision through creativity.\"",

      "description":"Pakistan head coach Saqlain Mushtaq has expressed confidence in the ability of the team's pace attack to deliver great performances in absence of its leader left-arm pacer Shaheen Afridi. <br/> Mohammad Hasnain will replace left-arm pacer Shaheen Afridi in Pakistan's 15-member squad for the T20 Asia Cup 2022, which begins on August 27. Afridi was ruled out of the upcoming Asia Cup after being advised a four-six weeks rest by the medical team following an injury to the right knee ligament. <br/>Mushtaq showed faith in right-arm pacers Naseem Shah, Mohammad Hasnain and Haris Rauf to deliver great performances. \"Since last few years, these three have been executing the plans and demands of the Pakistan team really well. The captain, me as a head coach and the entire support staff has confidence in their abilities. Shaheen used to lead the attack, but these three also on a given day or situation can change the game,\" said Mushtaq at a press conference. <br/> The head coach also said that coaches from the high-performance centre will be traveling with the team and the philosophy behind it is a \"Working Together\" philosophy. \"The coaches at the high-performance centre will go up with the main side and see how things are done. So when they return to the high-performance centre, these coaches will be able to work on lines of that philosophy,\" he added.",

      "description":"Punjab Kings has not renewed head coach Anil Kumble's contract, ending his tenure with the franchise. As per ESPNCricinfo, the decision was taken by a board comprising of multiple owners, which included Bollywood actor Preity Zinta, industrialists Mohit Burman, Ness Wadia and Karan Paul and King's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Satish Menon. <br/> They are currently looking out for a new coach, which will be announced soon. Ever since Kumble joined the franchise in 2020, the team finished in the lower half of the Indian Premier League (IPL) points table, fifth during 2020 and 2021 when the league had eight teams and sixth in the 2022 edition when it featured ten teams. <br/> He was the fifth coach to be appointed by the franchise, Sanjay Bangar (2014-16), Virender Sehwag (2017), Brad Hodge (2018) and Mike Hesson (2019). Kings were the third IPL team Kumble associated himself with after his playing days, having served as a mentor for Royal Challengers Bangalore and Mumbai Indians. This was before he was appointed as head coach of India in 2016 for a year. Kumble was in charge of the franchise for 42 games out of which he could win only 18, lost 22 and tied two. <br/> This is the second worst win-loss ratio for any IPL franchise since 2020, with Sunrisers Hyderabad at the top in this aspect. The side has made only two appearances in playoffs, including the final of the 2014 IPL. <br/>The constant changes in captaincy and coaching hurt the side in 2022 despite great buys at the auction. The buys included England stars Liam Livingstone and Jonny Bairstow, South African quick Kagiso Rabada, Indian opener Shikhar Dhawan and West Indies all-rounder Odean Smith. ",

      "description":"Anupam Kher is on cloud nine as both of his films released this year have turned out to be box office blockbusters, The Kashmir Files and Karthikeya 2. While the former is a hard-hitting political drama based on the exodus of the Kashmiri Pandits from the valley in the early 1990s, the latter is a mystery thriller focusing on the search to find Krishna's lost anklet in the sunken city of Dwarka. <br/> As major Hindi films such as Laal Singh Chaddha, Raksha Bandhan, and others such as Runway 34, Jersey, and Heropanti 2 have been major disappointments at the box office this year, South films just as RRR, KGF Chapter 2, and now Karthikeya 2 have worked wonders setting cash registers ringing at the ticket windows. <br/> Now, in a recent interview, Kher, who has acted in more than 500 films, shared his thoughts on the ongoing North vs South debate stating that the filmmakers down south are concentrating on telling better and more interesting stories, while Bollywood is still busy selling stars. <br/> Talking to ETimes, Anupam said, \"I'm not differentiating between the two but I think (their) cinema is relevant because they are not aping Hollywood. They are telling stories, over here we are selling stars. You make things for consumers. The problem starts when you start looking down on consumers saying, 'We are doing you a favour by making a great film. Now you are watching a great film.' Greatness is achieved by a collective effort and that I have learnt by doing films in Telugu, Tamil, and I'm going to do a Malayalam film.\"",
